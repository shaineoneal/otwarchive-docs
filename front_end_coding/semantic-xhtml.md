title: What is Semantic XHTML
---
In our [Coding Standards](coding-standards), we say that with semantic <abbr title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> we separate our content from our presentation. eXtensible HyperText Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets are flexible, accessible, and logical ways to mark up content for the web.

The combination of CSS and XHTML separates style from content: the way things **look** from what things **mean**. CSS takes care of how everything looks; XHTML controls what things mean. In this way, you can build consistent, logical documents that can be read on any device, by any user agent, whether that be a screen reader, a palm pilot, a printer, or whatever the *next* gadget might be.

It's faster and easier to code correctly, because there is a process of reasoning that you can follow. Instead of saying, "Oh, this is a book title, so it should be `<u>underlined</u>` or written in `<i>italics</i>`," you can just say, "Oh, this is `<cite>A Book Title</cite>`."

We do this because, while people can use context to understand why text has been italicized, computers can't understand that `<i>this</i>` word is emphasised but `<i>The Lord of the Rings</i>` is a book. You have to tell them that `<em>this</em>` word is emphasised and `<cite>The Lord of the Rings</cite>` is a book.

<h4 id="but-it-looks-bad">But it looks bad!</h4>

Once your content is marked up in a consistent, semantic, and logical manner, you can go wild with your presentational CSS. You can change the way your entire site looks by changing a single line in a single document. 

Returning to the example of book titles, if you used `<i>italics</i>` and later decided you would prefer to have the titles `<u>underlined</u>`, you would have to go through and replace all the `<i>` tags around book titles with `<u>` tags. This becomes particularly tricky if you have also used `<i>italics</i>` in place of `<em>emphasis</em>`. However, if you used semantic XHTML with `<cite>` and `<em>` tags, you could change the formatting of all book titles with just one line of CSS: `cite { text-decoration: underline; }`.
